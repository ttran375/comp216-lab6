### Question 1

Write a Python script to use FTP to download a file to a local drive. The remote FTP site is `ftp.cdc.gov` and you need to retrieve the `ART-2018-Clinic-Report-Full.pdf` by navigating to the `/pub/publications/ART/` subdirectory.

### Question 2

As most organizations migrate to the cloud (e.g., AWS), legacy solutions for FTP must be re-architected. Research and discuss one AWS native solution to enable file transfers into and out of AWS storage services.

### Question 3

Various applications have different requirements regarding data loss, throughput sensitivity, and time sensitivity. For the following application types, determine the following:

| **Application Type**            | **Requires Reliable Data Transfer?** | **Bandwidth-Sensitive Applications?** | **Requires Timing Guarantees?** |
